;Exercise 253. Each of these signatures describes a class of functions:
; [Number -> Boolean]
;IsEven?
; [Boolean String -> Boolean]
;Is#TrueAndTrue?
; [Number Number Number -> Number]
;Add3Integers
; [Number -> [List-of Number]]
;ListNumbersDownToZero
; [[List-of Number] -> Boolean]
;AllPositiveIntegers?
;Describe these collections with at least one example from ISL.
