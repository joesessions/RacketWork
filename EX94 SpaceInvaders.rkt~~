; every 10 ticks, x spd is changed randomly.
; it starts at 0
; randomly, it generates -2, -1, 0, 1 or 2. This value is added to the spd
; if the range exceeds 20-780, it is given a speed of +-2, headed back toward the middle
; and x is set to the 20 or 780.
; the spd max is 5, and if 6 or 7 is generated, 3 is subtracted from the speed. (or added, if -6 or -7)
; The speed is added to x at each tick.
; The y motion drops at DESCENT-SPEED (constant)
